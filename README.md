Scala Json Dsl 
==============

Note this project has branches step0 through stepN.  These branches form a step-by-step kata for test driving a scala-json parser.

To work through this project as a code kata, check out step0.  Build and run tests.  Fix the broken test, then check out the next step
for the next challenge.  Repeat until you've build the entire JSON parser for adding JSON as a DSL.

The project has the eclipse plug-in configured.  If you want to import your project into eclipse, do a 'sbt eclipse' to generate the 
eclipse project files for import.  You can also use typesafe activator instead of sbt.

Enjoy!
